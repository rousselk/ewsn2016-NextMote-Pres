\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction (1/2)}
\begin{block}{To develop and test large, ambitious WSN-based projects}
$\rightarrow$ need of powerful and accurate simulation/emulation tools
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Many such simulation/emulation tools exist}
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenSim (from OpenWSN project)
\item TOSSIM (from TinyOS project)
\item Cooja (from Contiki OS project)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{exampleblock}{This work focus on the latter framework: \textbf{Cooja}}
$\rightarrow$ (one of) the most used simulation/emulation tool
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction (2/2)}
\begin{block}{The present work focus on the two following subjects}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ability---\emph{actually tested and used}---to use the Cooja
framework to simulate/emulate systems not related to Contiki OS
\item The inaccuracies in time-related results we discovered while using
Cooja\footnote{Note we always used the Cooja version provided with
Contiki release 2.7} to perform our own simulations to test our own
WSN-related projects
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
